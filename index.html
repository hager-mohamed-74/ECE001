                Computer programming language, any of diverse languages for expressing a hard and fast of detailed commands for a digital pc. Such commands can be carried out at once while they are in the pc manufacturer-unique numerical form called machine language, after a simple substitution procedure whilst expressed in a corresponding assembly language, or after translation from some higher-level language. Although there are many computer languages, enormously few are extensively used. Machine and assembly languages are low-degree, requiring a programmer to manage explicitly all of a laptop's idiosyncratic features of statistics storage and operation.

                In contrast, high-stage languages defend a programmer from disturbing about such considerations and offer a notation this is more effortlessly written and study via programmers Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it). The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).

                Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common
