            <h2>Main Feature of Programming Languages</h2>
            <br>
            <div>
                The popularity of a programming language depends on the features and utilities it provides to programmers. The features that a programming language must have to stand out are the following:
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li><b> Simplicity: </b> the language must offer clear and simple concepts that facilitate its learning and application, in a way that is simple to understand and maintain. Simplicity does not mean that it can be subtracted from the optimal power of functioning. </li>
                <li><b> Naturalness: </b> this means that its application in the area for which it was designed must be done naturally, providing operators, structures and syntax for operators to work efficiently. </li>
                <li><b> Abstraction: </b> it is the ability to define and use complicated structures or operations while ignoring some details, which influences writing ability. </li>
                <li><b> Efficiency: </b> Programming languages must be translated and executed efficiently so as not to take up too much memory space or require too much time. </li>
                <li><b> Structuring: </b> the language allows programmers to write their codes according to structured programming concepts, to avoid creating errors. </li>
                <li><b> Compactness: </b> with this characteristic, it is possible to express operations concisely, without having to write too many details. </li>
                <li><b> Locality: </b> refers to the codes concentrating on the part of the program with which you are working at a given time. </li>
            </ol>
